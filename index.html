    <h2> Hello and welcome to my page, my name is <em>Niles</em>.</h2>
    <h3> About me </h3>
    <p> I'm from Lincoln City, Oregon. After graduating high school I moved up to Beaverton with two of my brothers to get a assocaites of science at PCC. After being unsure of what to do after that and having no clear path I saved up money to be a scuba diver in Thailand. During my stay over there the Covid-19 pandemic hit and I was forced to return to the States. A friend of mine is in software development and he had a friend go through the epicodus program so I decided to enroll and try to better myself. </p>
